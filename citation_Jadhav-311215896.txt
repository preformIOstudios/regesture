Jadhav, Sangeeta & D. Pawar, Jyoti. (2017). Aesthetics of BharataNatyam Poses Evaluated Through Fractal Analysis. 401-409. 10.1007/978-981-10-2471-9_39. 

Fractals are known for their aesthetic appeal. We have calculated the Fractal Dimension (FD) with the Box-Counting method for the Adavus, pure dance movements in BharataNatyam. These poses were found to be Fractal with the FD in the range of 1.3–1.5. This FD range has already been proved to be naturally aesthetically appealing to the human eye. Fractals have not been used so far for Indian Classical Dance (ICD) pose analysis. In this paper we have used FD for auto classification of system generated dance poses. This experimental study also reveals that the dance poses in the FD range of 1.5–1.6 are also found to be creative and appealing by the dance experts. Considering the classification ratings of system generated dance poses by an International dancer as Gold Standard data we have found that the Accuracy, Recall and F_Score to be 46 %, 52.63 % and 48.77 % respectively. The results are promising and encouraging for further research using FD with other parameters to measure the aesthetics of dance pose.
